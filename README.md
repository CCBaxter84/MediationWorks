## Heading ##
  > "We just need a good attorney who knows all about this stuff to mediate for us." <-- NO, YOU DON'T!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Everyone has disagreements or misunderstandings from time to time, but few realize how easy it is to get an affordable, experienced professional to help when conflicts become to big to fix by yourself.

## Summary ##
  > If you find youself entangled in a rancorous dispute threatening to drag you into civil court or other legal proceedings, then do you have any objections to taking a few minutes to see how a professional mediator can help amenably to the matter behind you without the court fees and headaches? I'm Mark Loye. I've been a Conflict Resolution Consultant and Group Facilitator for over 30 years, and I've love to help you. 

## Problem ##
  > There's a conventional wisdom out there that when you have a dispute with someone that reaches a critical mass the simple solution is: find an attorney. Unfornately, this intuitive but short-sighted approach leads countless people every year to spend a lot of money and time on attorney's fees and civil court proceedings. Sometimes this can even exacerbate disputes as both sides lawyer-up and hunker down for a protacted court case or proceeding. Even if you "win" a case like this you can often come out behind in terms of the time and costs you had to incur.

## Solution ##
  > Professional mediators can often help you solve disagreements that are overly encroaching on important areas of your life more cheaply, quickly, and amicably than engaging an attorney. While mediators are not attorneys and consequently cannot provide legal advice, they bring to the table experience years or even decades of experience at skills lawyers generally lack -- 1) helping agrieved parties better understand each other's perspective and 2) facilitating mutually agreeable solutions.
